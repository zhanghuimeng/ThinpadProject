 There are 0 register/latch pins which need pulse_width check


4. checking unconstrained_internal_endpoints
--------------------------------------------
 There are 3486 pins that are not constrained for maximum delay. (HIGH)

 There are 0 pins that are not constrained for maximum delay due to constant clock.


5. checking no_input_delay
--------------------------
 There are 66 input ports with no input delay specified. (HIGH)

 There are 0 input ports with no input delay but user has a false path constraint.


6. checking no_output_delay
---------------------------
 There are 134 ports with no output delay specified. (HIGH)

 There are 0 ports with no output delay but user has a false path constraint

 There are 0 ports with no output delay but with a timing clock defined on it or propagating through it


7. checking multiple_clock
--------------------------
 There are 0 register/latch pins with multiple clocks.


8. checking generated_clocks
----------------------------
 There are 0 generated clocks that are not connected to a clock source.


9. checking loops
-----------------
 There are 0 combinational loops in the design.

11. checking partial_output_delay
---------------------------------
 There are 0 ports with partial output delay specified.


12. checking latch_loops
